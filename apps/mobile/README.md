# Mobile app (bare React Native)

This is a placeholder directory for the Seeker-first bare React Native app.

## Planned stack
- Bare React Native
- Solana Mobile SDK (Seed Vault)
- Shared packages:
  - `@pitstopprotocol/core`
  - `@pitstopprotocol/chain`

## Bootstrap (to implement)
We will initialize with `react-native init` (or the recommended Solana Mobile starter) and then wire in the shared packages.
