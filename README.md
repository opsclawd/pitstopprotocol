# PitStop Protocol

This repo is now in **spec-first + TDD pivot mode** for a USDC-based Anchor protocol.

## Current phase
- No new feature code until spec pack is approved.
- Source of truth is the locked spec set in root:
  - `SPEC_PROTOCOL.md`
  - `SPEC_INVARIANTS.md`
  - `SPEC_CANONICAL.md`
  - `SPEC_THREAT_MODEL.md`
  - `SPEC_INSTRUCTIONS/`

## Process gates
- 1 PR per issue
- Spec first -> tests first -> implementation
- Independent review pass -> fix pass -> final review-summary comment
- PR descriptions must include file-by-file summary
