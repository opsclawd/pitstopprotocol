# Test Strategy (TDD first)

## Locked test categories
1. Unit tests (canonicalization + math)
2. Instruction behavior tests
3. Invariant/property tests
4. Adversarial/forgery tests

## Matrix target
- Unit: 10+
- Instruction behavior: ~60
- Invariants: 10-15
- Adversarial: 8-12

## Rule
No feature code merges without executable spec tests for that feature.
